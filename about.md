Welcome visitor! Make yourself comfortable! I'm Pere Villega, a software developer born in Barcelona and currently living in London. I'm a Scala contractor with several years of experience developing applications. This page is correct as of May 2016 :)


## So who I am?

I'm a nerd. Correction, a [happily married][6] nerd :) 

I like coding. I've been doing stuff for many years, trying new technologies, and doing small personal projects. Many of them are lost as they were not "relevant" (amateurish hacks which I did not keep when replacing computers), but I publish some in [Github][3].

I love reading, mostly fantasy and sci-fi but also some classics, although I won't read a book just because it's popular. I read quite a bit, I had to replace a Kindle due to use. I get hooked on stories, I need to know what will happen next. And I read fast :) 

I play games. Board games, role games, computer games... you name it. I enjoy them, more so if they are strategy games. Sadly, I don't have as much time for them as I would like. Little secret: I want to create my own game. Someday.

I support Manchester United. To be honest I don't watch many matches, if any at all. But I support them. Not every choice has to be rational, does it?

I like Linux. And Android. And Apple computers. Is that bad? :)


## What do I do?

I solve problems using software. Technically I'm a software developer, but titles aside my job is to solve issues using software. To make people happy (or less unhappy) via a computer.

I like coding and I've spent quite a bit of time on side projects, for example the [Play Modules website][7]. I was part of [Google Summer of Code][8] in 2010. You can find a list of some projects I have been involved with [here](/projects/).

I also enjoy learning new technologies and the theory behind it. I favour learning fundamentals (like functional programming concepts) over a language, as fundamentals can be used with many different languages or frameworks.


## What is this?

This is my personal page, built using [Jekyll][9] and deployed to Github pages. I had an [old site][1] that I built myself using Play Framework, but I decided to migrate it to what you see. 

Life happens and I have periods in which I can't blog as much as I'd like. If you see a lack of posts, check my [Github profile][3]. I may be busy in there, or in some other non-public engagement.

Feel free to [clone][2] and deploy your own version of this site if you like it. If you have comments on the site or its content, please [contact me][4]. I promise I'm a nice guy, and I'll try to answer. Of course you are not required to, but I would really appreciate it. 

That said, spam and other [Netiquette][5] violations are a big no-no. Be nice ;)
