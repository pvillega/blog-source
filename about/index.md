Welcome visitor! Make yourself comfortable! I'm Pere Villega, a software developer born in Barcelona and living in London. I'm currently working for [Gumtree.com](http://www.gumtree.com/) as Lead Software Engineer.


## So who I am?

I'm a nerd. Correction, a [happily married][6] nerd, and (I believe) a decent husband :) 


I like coding. I've been doing stuff for many years, trying new technologies, doing small personal projects. Many of them are lost as they were not "relevant" (amateurish hacks which I did not keep when replacing computers), but I store some stuff in [Github][3]. My love for programming has grown a lot since I discovered Scala and Play Framework. I feel comfortable working with them and the way they facilitate creating new apps motivates me to spend more time using them. 


I love reading. In fact, I like it so much that I have no TV at home. No time for it. Since I got my new Kindle I've read hundreds of books (and the list keeps increasing), including all the saga of Capitan Alatriste, Malazan Book of the Fallen saga, The Hunger Games trilogy, the full Vorkosigan saga (with Ethan of Athos and Falling Free) and several others. I get hooked on stories, I need to know what will happen next. And I read fast :) 

I play games. Board games, role games, videogames... you name it. I enjoy them, more so if they are strategy games. Sadly, I don't have as much time for them as I would like, as between coding and playing, coding wins the battle. Little secret: I want to create my own game. Someday.

I support Manchester United. To be honest I don't watch many matches, if any at all. But I support them. Not every choice has to be rational, does it?

I like Linux. And Android, of which I own one. I can't see myself using a restrictive platform for personal use.


## What do I do?

I solve problems using software. Technically I'm a software developer, but I don't like how this gives a limited vision of the task. My job is to solve issues using software. To make something work properly to fulfil a need. To make people happy (or less unhappy) via a computer.

I like coding and I spend part of my free time collaborating with open source projects, for example the [Play Modules website][7] ). I was part of [Google Summer of Code][8] in 2010, and I've actively collaborated with the local Scala user group. You can find a list of some projects I have been involved with in this site.

Lately, I find myself using mostly Scala in my free time. I enjoy the flexibility it provides and how it allows me to focus in what I want to create instead of spending time paying attention to boilerplate. 

I also enjoy learning new things as I believe that, in such a dynamic world as the technology one, if you want to solve problems being able to grasp new concepts fast is more important than becoming a niche expert.


## What is this?

This is my personal page, built using [Octopress][9] and deployed to Github pages. I had an [old site][1] that I built myself using Play Framework, but going that path was trying to reinvent the wheel. A nice experience, not so practical. So I decided to migrate it to what you see. 

I've never been a huge fan of the blog templates. I hate layouts in which you seem to be forced to write just to not show that you didn't for the last month. Hard to show you were coding instead. So, if you see a lack of posts, check my [Github profile][3]. I may be busy in there.

Feel free to [clone][2] and deploy your own version of this site if you like it. If you have comments on the site or its content, please [contact me][4]. I promise I'm a nice guy, and I'll try to answer. Of course you are not required to, but I would really appreciate it. 

That said, spam and other [Netiquette][5] violations are a big no-no. Be nice ;)
