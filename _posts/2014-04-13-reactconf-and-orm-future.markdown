I've been pretty busy lately at [Gumtree](http://www.gumtree.com/), but I still got time to publish some posts in our [Dev Team blog](http://www.gumtree.com/devteam/). 
<!-- more -->
The first one, which has got quite a lot of traction, is [The end of ORM](http://www.gumtree.com/devteam/2014-04-01-the-end-of-orm.html) where I talk about how Akka persistence may be the solution for the headaches ORM cause.

The second, split in two parts, is a summary of the talks in [React.conf 2014](http://reactconf.com/). I was very lucky to attend that event, and I posted the notes I took on [day 1](http://www.gumtree.com/devteam/2014-04-08-React-conf-day-1.html) and [day 2](http://www.gumtree.com/devteam/2014-04-08-React-conf-day-2.html). Be warned that the notes are not curated, just details on the talks for those who couldn't attend and wanted to get some more details before the videos are released.

As always, feedback via Twitter/Email is more than welcome.
